# Generating and Analyzing Network Traffic in Diverse Network Conditions
General Info TODO

## Background
TODO

## Tool
Our tool establishes Docker containers with configurable network conditions,
then runs target behaviors such as browsing the internet, and collects data on
the network traffic generated using
[network-stats](https://github.com/parkeraddison/network-stats/tree/5e4173d310faf40b7f35262e0a18e447ba91e5dc).

To use the tool, you must configure your desired network conditions and behaviors.

Source code for the tool can be found at [network-data-generation](https://github.com/parkeraddison/network-data-generation).

### Requirements
The data collcetion tool runs on Linux. You will need:
* [Docker 19.03+](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* [Docker Compose 1.27+](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

### Configuration

See [`tool.json`](https://github.com/parkeraddison/generating-and-analyzing-network-traffic-in-diverse-network-conditions/blob/main/config/tool.json) for configuration:

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| behaviors | List of one or more target behaviors. All target behaviors will be run for each specified set of network conditions. For possible values see [Target behaviors](#target-behaviors). |
| conditions | List of nested configuration specifying desired network conditions. E.g. `[{"latency": "50ms", "bandwidth": "10Mbps"}]`. For configuration see [Conditions config](#conditions-config). |
| vpn | Nested configuration for a VPN connection. For configuration see [VPN Config](#vpn-config). |

<a name="target-behaviors"></a>
**Target behaviors**
| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ping | Ping a DNS server once every three seconds. |
| script | Run a script that replicates the `ping` behavior. **Will be deprecated**. |
| none | Do nothing. |
| browsing | Run a script to endlessly browse Twitter. |
| streaming | Run a script to endlessly watch YouTube. |

<a name="conditions-config"></a>
**Conditions config**
| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| latency | Milliseconds. The desired amount of network latency to be injected. E.g. `"50ms"` |
| bandwidth | Megabits per second. The desired download speed. E.g. `"10Mbps"` |

<a name="vpn-config"></a>
**VPN config**
| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| enabled | `true` or `false`. Whether or not a VPN should be used. **WIP** |
| server | URL or IP to the desired VPN service. E.g. `"vpn.ucsd.edu"`. **WIP** |

### Environment file and secrets

The containers will need secret variables that store things like VPN or website login credentials.

Please create a file named `.env` and place it in this directory. Inside the file, add the login information for your VPN:
```
VPN_USERNAME=<your UCSD username>
VPN_USERGROUP=<the 'group' to use for the VPN -- probably "2-Step Secured - allthruucsd">
VPN_PASSWORD=<your UCSD password>
```

### Running

Once you're satisfied with your configuration, simply open a terminal to this directory, and run
```bash
make
```

When you're done collecting data, open a new terminal in this directory and run
```bash
make stop
```

### Data

After the tool has been stopped, data can be found in `data/`.
