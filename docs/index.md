# Tool (Used for Data Collection)
Our tool establishes Docker containers with configurable network conditions,
then runs target behaviors such as browsing the internet, and collects data on
the network traffic generated using
[network-stats](https://github.com/parkeraddison/network-stats/tree/5e4173d310faf40b7f35262e0a18e447ba91e5dc).

To use the tool, you must configure your desired network conditions and behaviors.

Source code for the tool can be found at network-data-generation.
